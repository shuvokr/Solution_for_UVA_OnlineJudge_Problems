For solve a problem first try it by yourself. 
If you think that you need some hints for solve the problem try to discuss someone or 
try to understand the solution from the code & then think yourself what you think about for solve the problem.
You also see the solution for the purpose of knowing multiple solution for a problem. 

Don't try to COPY PEAST, its only harmful for you.
